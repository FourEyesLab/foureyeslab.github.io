We have collected or created several datasets for various purposes, and make them available for research purposes to everyone. Please cite our corresponding papers appropriately if you use them in published work. Thank you!

Computer Vision & Augmented Reality

- [tracking.mat.ucsb.edu](http://tracking.mat.ucsb.edu/) – a large repository of video-based panorama data sets with lots of extra data
- The [City of Sights](http://cityofsights.icg.tu-graz.ac.at/) (collaboration with TU Graz and TU Munich) – provides a virtual and physical model for augmented reality research
- A [dataset for visual tracking](http://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu/tracking_dataset_ijcv) consisting of 96 videos including accurate ground truth

Data Mining & Data Visualization

We have several large datasets with thousands of transactional or relational data, used for data & graph mining and visualization. At the moment, we are unable to make those publicly available. Please contact John O'Donovan if you are interested in this data.
